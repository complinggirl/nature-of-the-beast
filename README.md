# Hey

This is a little side project I'm working on with a friend. Maybe it will go somewhere, maybe it won't. It was bootstrapped with create-react-app version 2.1.1, with the typescript flag.

## To run:

It shouldn't be too hard.

-   `$ npm install`
-   `$ npm start`

## To deploy to github pages

found at http://vcolavin.com/nature-of-the-beast/

-   `$ npm run deploy`

### Todo list

-   [ ] keep cursor at the end of the prompt when moving through history
-   [ ] use Redux instead of a POJO
-   [ ] fix issue where QuietForest is appearing as undefined in neighbors
-   [ ] tests???? especially for the utilities
-   [ ] make the console writer function public (i.e. it shouldn't need to be passed explicitly)
-   [ ] make input prompt change based on location
-   [ ] get text to wrap correctly on long passages
-   [ ] cooler terminal styling (e.g. https://css-tricks.com/old-timey-terminal-styling/)
-   [ ] date utility (probably replicate `date +%s`)
-   [ ] uptime utility (this could be a source of spooky mysteries)
